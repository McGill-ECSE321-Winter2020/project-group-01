# ECSE321 Project Group 1 ![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2020/project-group-01.svg?token=fsmRFkAy9TTnJy5UEPzf&branch=master) [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2020/project-group-01)

## Project Overview(*)
We are developing a website and an Android app to facilitate the pet adoption process of a local pet shelter. In this system,
users can post advertisements to put their pets up for adoption. They can also apply to adopt a pet on an advertisement
posted by a user or by the shelter itself. The system is implemented in teams of 5. The implementation of this system
requires requirements engineering, software development, validation of the system through unit testing and automation of the software
delivery process.

### About us
We are 5 McGill University students from the Faculty of Engineering
